Open a terminal and type:

<code>npm create-react-app any-name
cd any-name
rm -rf src
git clone https://github.com/LightY-01/Web-Dev/tree/main/src
cd src
rm Readme.md
cd ..
npm start
</code>
With this you can open this web app in a linux machine.

The key takeaway is just to replace the src file that gets created upon creating a react app with the src file in this github page (removing Readme.md file is not necessary).
